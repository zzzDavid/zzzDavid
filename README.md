## Hi there, I'm Niansong Zhang 


<img align="right" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxzx2bxch/image/upload/v1603289150/github/video-game_nf4jyq.svg" width="80px"/> I'm an ECE MS/PhD student at Computer System Lab, Cornell University.

Currently, I'm working on a few interesting projects with the following labs:

- [NICS-EFC](http://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxzx2bxch/image/upload/v1603287964/github/1200px-Tsinghua_University_Logo.svg_zzzlho.png" width="15" height="15"/> 
- [CSL](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxzx2bxch/image/upload/v1607669548/github/cornell_ihqpcw.png"  height="15"/>
- [WatCAG](https://nachiket.github.io/research.html) at the University of Waterloo <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxzx2bxch/image/upload/v1607669548/github/waterloo_g8u1qm.png" height="15"/>

I was an intern at [NOVAUTO](https://www.novauto.com.cn/) Technology.

I worked at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) on Domain-Specific Language for Agile Design from Feburary to August 2021.

I want to make hardware designing and implementation faster and easier.

- **FPGA Compiler**

I worked on an automatic hard block placer [RapidLayout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06998) with Prof. Nachiket Kapre at the University of Waterloo. We want to make placement for large-scale accelerators faster and easier. This project is still active as we work to bring RapidLayout more general.

- **Deep Learning Tool Chain**

At NICS lab and Novauto Technology, I worked on deploying neural networks on FPGAs. Specifically, this process includes network pruning, quantization and compilation. I maintain a set of tools to deploy TensorFlow, PyTorch and Caffe neural network models on Xilinx FPGA. 

- **Domain-Specific Languages**

I am in the developer team of [HeteroCL](https://heterocl.csl.cornell.edu/), a next-generation heterogenous DSL. HeteroCL decouples key hardware customizations from the algorithm specification, which boosts hardware developing efficiency and design portability. I developed a SystemC backend to generate ASIC design at Intel. Currently, there are many exciting projects going on around HeteroCL, including efforts for hardware verification, sparse architectures, and MLIR integration.

I maintain a personal blog website: [zzzdavid.tech](https://www.zzzdavid.tech). Just trying to put down things I'm doing and stuff that I read or learned.
